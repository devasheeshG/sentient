### üí¨ Unified Chat Interface
The home page is a universal chat screen where you can talk with Sentient about anything. Use **text or voice** to ask questions, give commands, or simply have a conversation. The chat is also supercharged with tools like Internet Search, Weather, News, and Shopping for any specific queries.

### ü§ñ Autonomous Task Management
The **Tasks page** is your mission control center. Here you can add, view, and manage all your to-dos.
- **AI-Assisted Execution:** Describe a high-level goal, and Sentient will generate a detailed, step-by-step plan to achieve it using its integrated tools.
- **Asynchronous Workflows:** Approve a plan, and Sentient gets to work in the background, handling complex, multi-step workflows without interrupting you. You can monitor progress in real-time.
- **Unified View:** Track active, pending, and completed tasks all in one place.

### üîå Seamless Integrations
The **Integrations page** is where you connect Sentient to your digital life. Our **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** hub allows for a powerful, distributed system of tools. Current integrations include:
- **Google Suite:** Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides.
- **Productivity:** Slack and Notion.
- **Developer:** GitHub.
- **Information:** Internet Search (Google Search), News (NewsAPI), Weather (AccuWeather), Google Shopping and Google Maps.
- **Miscellaneous:** QuickChart for generating charts on the fly.

### üß† Proactive Intelligence & Learning
Sentient doesn't just wait for commands. It proactively scans connected apps like **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** to understand your schedule and priorities.
- **Contextual Awareness:** It identifies action items, suggests tasks, and learns important facts about you.
- **Personalized Memory:** Key details about your preferences, relationships, and goals are stored via an integration with **Supermemory**, creating a rich, personalized knowledge base that helps the agent serve you better over time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Full Customization
The **Settings page** gives you complete control over your agent.
- **Manage Connections:** Easily connect or disconnect your apps.
- **Privacy Filters:** Set custom filters to prevent Sentient from processing context containing sensitive information.
- **Notifications:** Configure WhatsApp notifications to stay updated on the go.

### üîí Self-Hostable
The entire platform is open-source and can be self-hosted and configured to run fully locally, ensuring your data stays private. [Check the relevant docs for more info.](https://sentient-2.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/running-sentient-from-source-self-host)

- **Advanced Conversational AI:** Enhance the chat experience with more natural voice interactions, better memory, and more sophisticated reasoning.
