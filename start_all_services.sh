#
# SYNOPSIS:
#   Starts all backend services, workers, and the frontend client for the
#   Sentient project on a Linux environment.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script automates the startup of all necessary services for local
#   development. It launches each service in its own dedicated terminal window
#   with a clear title.
#
# NOTES:
#   - Run this script from the project's root directory.
#   - You might need to install 'gnome-terminal' or change the TERMINAL_CMD
#     variable below to your preferred terminal emulator (e.g., konsole, xterm, terminator).
#   - Ensure services like MongoDB and Redis are installed and enabled on your system.
#   - This script may require 'sudo' for starting system services.
#
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Select your preferred terminal emulator to launch services.
# If you encounter "symbol lookup error" with gnome-terminal (a common issue with Snap),
# try changing this to a different terminal you have installed.
#
# Examples:
# TERMINAL_CMD="xterm -e"
# TERMINAL_CMD="konsole -e"
# This command forces a new window for each service, which is ideal for Alt+Tabbing.
TERMINAL_CMD="gnome-terminal --window --"
# If the above still fails due to Snap issues, a great alternative is Terminator:
# TERMINAL_CMD="terminator -e"

# --- Script Body ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# --- Helper Functions ---

    # CRITICAL FIX: Unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH to prevent conflicts with Snap-based terminals.
    # This allows gnome-terminal (as a Snap) to launch correctly from the script's environment.
    # The rest of the command sets the window title and keeps it open after execution.

    $TERMINAL_CMD /bin/bash -c "echo -ne '\033]0;${title}\a'; ${command}; exec bash" &
